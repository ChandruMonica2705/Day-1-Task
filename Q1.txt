Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
 =>HTTP1.1
     a) It is very slow compared with HTTP2 since it doesnot prioritize the contents and affects the webpage load time.
     b) It loads the resources one after other hence it blocks the upcoming resources.
     c) It gives the content only if the client asks,so it requires lot of request.
     d) HTTP1.1 makes header compression to speed up web performance.
 =>HTTP2
     a) HTTP2 gives a feature called weighted prioritization makes the resources to load faster.
     b) It uses single TCP connection that performs multiplexing without blocking any resource.
     c) HTTP2 uses "push" operation that lets the client to access multiple resources.
     d) It uses advanced compression method called HPACK which eliminates redundant header packets and improves the web performance.
